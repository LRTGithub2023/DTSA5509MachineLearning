Applying Regression and Ensemble Techniques to Predict Stock Prices.-

Welcome! And thank you for taking the time to read and grade my work.

This delivereable is split in the following parts:
1) a pdf report, which you can find in this repository.
2) the code.

The code is also split in 4 files:
1) source the data from yahoo finance. The data set is very large.
Save updateYFDataRev0.py in your chosen directory.
Create a subdirectory "data".
Run the .py file. The data will be saved in 'data'.
2) Save this file in 'data': sp500ListWiki.csv
3) Process and model the data.
Save week7EnsembleRFRev0.py in your chosen main directory.
4) Final results.
Save resultsDF.csv in your chosen main directory.

I initiated the project with single predictor and multi predictor linear regression models. 
These models take quite a bit of time to run and their results are less accurate than the efficient 
5 models based on decision trees, random forest, and ensemble methods I built later.
I have wrapped the linear regression models in a function and commented it out.
You may run the code if you chose to. 
To do so, uncomment the function, and follow the instructions in the code. 
You may need to delete some the saved files if you decide to run this piece of code more than once.
